## Circuit Design
The circuit design includes a step-down transformer, diode circuit, filter circuit, and voltage regulator. Each component plays a crucial role in converting the input AC signal to a regulated DC output.

## Circuit Transient Analysis Results
The LTSpice implementation of the proposed circuit is discussed, showcasing the input and output voltages of the step-down transformer and the overall system output with refined resistor and capacitor values.

## Hardware Implementation (Bonus)
The hardware implementation was carried out by Omar Elsayed , Ahmed Yasser, and Mahmoud Radwan. The implementation includes the diode circuit rectification, capacitive filter addition, and voltage regulator circuit, resulting in a rectified and regulated DC output.
